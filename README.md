# History

This repository stores my encrypted ZSH history, pushed from my main PC.
Other devices I use can pull this history into their own local `~/.zsh_history` when necessary.

Pushing and pulling from this repository is handled by [wulfgarpro/history-sync](https://github.com/wulfgarpro/history-sync).
My configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/krishnans2006/dotfiles/blob/main/.zshrc#L126-L129).

Future plans:
- Automate pushing command history from my main PC
- Multi-device support (devices can "add to" the pushed history, making it truly global)
